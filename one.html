            <h3>The Introduction</h3>
            <p>Milkman is set in Northern Ireland during the 1970s, at the height of the Troubles. The narrator is an unnamed 18-year-old girl, known as middle sister, living in an unnamed city sympathetic to the republican cause. Milkman, a high-ranking paramilitary officer, takes an interest in the girl, beginning to stalk her and offer her unwanted car rides. Rumours spread that the girl is having an affair with the married Milkman, straining her relationship with her mother and the wider community. These rumours compound as the girl continues her relationship with her "maybe-boyfriend," who she has been dating for a year but struggles to commit to.</p>
            <p>As Milkman's stalking becomes more intense, he makes veiled threats of killing maybe-boyfriend if she does not break up with him. The girl becomes more withdrawn and she and maybe-boyfriend drift apart. When the girl meets with her "longest friend from primary school," her friend suggests the girl's oblivious behavior, particularly "reading-while-walking," has led her to become a social pariah and thus enabled the rumours. During this meeting, the girl is poisoned by "tablets girl," a mentally ill local woman. The girl becomes severely sick, but recovers. Tablets girl is found murdered soon after, and the community assumes Milkman killed her as revenge for harming the narrator, further souring her reputation within the community.</p>
            <p>The girl and maybe-boyfriend break up over a tense phone call. The girl goes to his house to reconcile, but discovers he is in love with and more committed to his best friend. Resigning herself to her fate, the girl finally accepts a ride from Milkman back to her house. Milkman promises to take her on a date the next evening. However, that morning, Milkman is shot and killed by British security forces. While the girl is at a club, she is ambushed in the bathroom by another intermittent stalker, Somebody McSomebody, who threatens to kill her. The girl is saved by the other women in the bathroom beating him up. With her stalkers no longer troubling her, the girl's life returns to a state of normality.</p>
